            <p>I was born and raised in Montelago Naujan Oriental Mindoro.
                 I'm always confident about the combination of my experience, knowledge, and qualities. 
                 I'm always an academic achiever when I'm in grade school and highschool. 
                On personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precised to what I'm doing.</p>

                <p>Variety of career opinions- IT is not something about computers and its hardware,
                     in fact it is about the technology, it is spread its work areas in world wide web(www) and web development and technical writer etc.
                    Practical aspects- students like me always will be in dilemma whether what we are studying is really applied in real life or not.</p>

                <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
                <p> Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. They are not artist and they need to stop thinking they are artist.
                     When dealing with art and design specific demographics and viewers interpret the messages of each subject in different ways. 
                     Art is said to be elucidated and design is said to be understood. </p>

                <h3>Photo Journalist</h3>
                <p>  Simply speaking, a photojournalist's role is to relate a story through photography. The goal is not only to take pictures, 
                    but to hold the images up to the highest journalistic standards in an effort to convey the truth. Not every one of a photojournalist's
                     images will pass the test, just as every traditional journalist has to pitch multiple stories before one is accepted.</p>

                <p>People have different opinions on whether or not beauty contests, or pageants, serve a purpose in today's society. 
                    Some opinions may be that beauty contests serve no purpose in society; they may think beauty contests just cause young girls
                     and women to think that they have to reach society's description of beauty, 
                    they may think that what makes a person beautiful is just what is on the inside, they may even think they are degrading to women.</p>
